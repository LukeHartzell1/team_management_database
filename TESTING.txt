Testing Instructions for Team Member Management Application
=============================================================

Manual Testing:
---------------
1. **Access the Application:**
   - Make migrations using 'python manage.py makemigrations' then 'python manage.py migrate'
   - Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`
   - Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and verify that the home page displays the list of team members.

2. **List Page:**
   - Confirm that the header shows the correct count of team members.
   - Use the search box to filter team members by name.
   - Click on a team member to navigate to the Edit page.

3. **Add Page:**
   - Click the "+ Add" button to navigate to the Add page.
   - Fill in all required fields (first name, last name, phone number, email, and select a role).
   - Click "Save" and verify that the new team member appears on the List page with a success notification.

4. **Edit Page:**
   - Click on an existing team member to open the Edit page.
   - Modify one or more fields and click "Save". Ensure that the changes are visible on the List page.
   - Click the "Delete" button, confirm the deletion, and verify that the team member is removed with a notification.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Try submitting the form with missing fields to see inline validation.
   - Optionally, simulate server errors (e.g., by stopping the server) to confirm that error notifications display appropriately.

Automated Testing:
-------------------
1. **Django Tests:**
   - Run all tests using:
     ```
     python manage.py test members
     ```
   - Confirm that all tests in `members/tests.py` pass.

2. **API Testing:**
   - Use a tool like Postman or curl to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to:
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/members/api/team-members/
     ```
   - Validate that the responses are correct.

3. **Browser Tools:**
   - Use your browserâ€™s developer tools (Console and Network tabs) to monitor API calls and ensure that notifications and error messages are working as expected.

Additional Recommendations:
---------------------------
- Test across different browsers to ensure compatibility.
- After making any modifications, update tests accordingly.
- For further front-end testing, consider using automated tools such as Selenium or Cypress if desired.

Happy Testing!
